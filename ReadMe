# Build Environment
* jdk 1.8.0_152-b16
* maven 3.3.9

# Assumptions
* A loan/quote can be built from multiple offer
* An offer can be bundled to a loan partially (i.e. an offer providing £100 can be selected but only borrow £10 from it)
* If multiple offers provided with the same rate, the small amount will be selected first.
* Multithread concurrency is not supported
* Run the app will generate one loan only and does not support to generate another loan(The offers selected are not
removed from available. Can be improved.)
