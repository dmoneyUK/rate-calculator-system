# Build Environment
* jdk 1.8.0_152-b16
* maven 3.3.9

# Assumptions
* A loan/quote can be built from multiple offer
* An offer can be bundled to a loan partially (i.e. an offer providing £100 can be selected but only borrow £10 from it.)
* If multiple offers provided with the same rate, the small amount will be selected first.
* Multithread concurrency is not supported
* Run the app will generate one loan only and does not support to generate another loan(The offers selected are not
removed from available. Can be improved.)
* Some improvement can be done (checking, testing) if time allows, put some comments there
* The c P* [(1 + i) ]


# Execution
* mvn install from the project's root folder;
* find the jar file in the targe
* run the java -jar <absolute_path_to_file> <request_amount>
example:
java -jar rate-calculation-system-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar /Users/jinge.dai/GitHub/rate-calculation-system/src/test/resources/test_market_data.csv 1000
