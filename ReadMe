# Build Environment
* jdk 1.8.0_152-b16
* maven 3.3.9

# Assumptions
* A loan/quote can be built from multiple offer
* An offer can be bundled to a loan partially (i.e. an offer providing £100 can be selected but only borrow £10 from it)
* If multiple offers provided with the same rate, any one could be selected. (Could be improved to select the small amount first)
* Multithread concurrency is not supported
